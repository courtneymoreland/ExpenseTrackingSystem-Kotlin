# Overview

This software project demonstrates the use of the Kotlin programming language to create an Expense Tracking System. As a software engineer, the purpose of this project is to learn and practice Kotlin's syntax and features while building a practical application for tracking and managing personal expenses.

The Expense Tracking System allows users to add, view, calculate total expenses, save expenses to a file, load expenses from a file, remove expenses, sort expenses by category or amount, and search for expenses using keywords.

For a detailed demonstration of the software and a walkthrough of the code, you can watch the [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here). The video provides insights into how Kotlin's features are used to create this application.
